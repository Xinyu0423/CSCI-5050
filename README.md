# CSCI-5050

## Semester Took this Course
Spring 2021

## Grade
A

## Note for This Class
1. This class is a Capstone class, and each group works with different companies. Due to confidentiality reasons, I cannot release the content of our group's work. So only the lecture slides of the course.
2. This semester, we are mainly working on our own projects, and we seldom take classes, so there is very little content in the courseware.

## Note
1. This repo is for me to store my work for this class. So please **DO NOT** use it for plagiarism. Thus If you check out my work, please use it only as a way to get inspiration. Again, **DO NOT** use it for plagiarism.
2. If you are Professor/TA for this class and think my content violates your teaching, please email me with a proof of your identity at xiji6874@colorado.edu. I will delete it for you.
3. Please **DO NOT** email me with questions about my/your assignemnts, you should finish your work by yourself. I won't reply to those emails. (The only reason you're emailing me should be that some of my content violates your course content).
4. Some parts of the assignment may be wrong because I don't remember each assignment grades, so I put my grades for this course for your reference. Again please just have it for inspiration and **DO NOT** use it for plagiarism.
5. The predecessors planted trees, and the later generations enjoyed the shade. I also got a lot of inspiration from other people's repo in the process of learning, so I uploaded my course material, I hope these content will help you.
